Summary of The Checklist Manifesto: How to get things right
==============================
Atul Gawande's *The Checklist Manifesto* is a smart and quick read by a surgeon convinced of the utility of checklists. All content here is credited to the author. 

Introduction
-----------------
Two stories about surgery:

 1. A fat guy comes in to a San Francisco emergency room with a routine stab wound on halloween. He almost dies when it turns out to be an incredibly deep puncture, all the way to his heart. Turns out he was stabbed by a costumed guy with a huge bayonet. "You just don't think of a bayonet in SF."
 1. Guy comes in for routine surgery, then flatlines on the operating table. While they do CPR, the surgeons can’t figure out why. Eventually someone figures out that he was a given a potassium dose prior to the surgery, and that the dose was 100x higher than it should have been.

So why do we fail when we have so much training and knowledge? Three main reasons:

 1. Because of necessary fallibility—things are just too complicated or unknown to us.
 1. Ignorance—something may be possible, but science hasn’t yet given us a good enough picture of it.
 1. Ineptitude—the knowledge exists somewhere but we fail to apply it correctly

Today nearly all our failures have shifted to ineptitude, while a half century ago they were probably mostly due to ignorance. We know how to prevent and treat heart attacks, but only half of heart attack cases are properly treated (the treatment is complicated, with lots of steps and possibilities for failure). Why is it so hard to get it right?

“Failures of ignorance we can forgive. If the knowledge of the best thing to do in a given situation does not exist, we are happy to have people simply make their best effort. But if the knowledge exists and is not applied correctly, it is difficult not to be infuriated.”

* We have accumulated stupendous know-how.
* Nonetheless, the know-how is often unmanageable. Avoidable failures are common and persistent, not to mention demoralizing and frustrating.
* This is because the volume and complexity of what we know has exceeded our individual ability to deliver its benefits correctly, safely, or reliably.
* The solution is very simple: A checklist.

Chapter 1: The Problem of Extreme Complexity
---------------------
A story about an amazing rescue and recovry: A little girl was lost on the bottom of an icy fish pond in the Austrian Alps for 30 minutes. When her parents found her they did CPR for eight minutes until the first responders arrived, who found her with no activity and 66-degree Fahrenheit body temperature. They continued CPR anyway until she got to the ER, where the surgeons put her on a heart-lung bypass machine. After size hours her body temp came back up. Her lungs were too full of water for the mechicanal breathing machine to work, so they put her on an articiual lung (sewing tubes directly into her aorta) and cut her chest open to carefully vacuum water and pond debris out of her lungs all night. More procedures followed, and she was finally sewn back up, but stayed in a coma for two weeks before finally awakening and making a full recovery. 

What makes the recovery astounding isn't just that someone can be brought back to life after two hours not breathing but that a random team could pull off so many complicated tasks without making any critical mistakes. Clinicians have six thousand drugs and four thousand medical and surgical procedures. "It is a lot to get right."

Over the course of ayear, an average doctor at a particular hospital in Boston sees 250 primary diseases and conditions, 900 active medical problems, prescribes 300 drugs, orders 100 lab tests, and performed 40 kinds of office procedures. An ICU patient requires 178 different procedures per day. So many mistakes are possible that "at any time, we are as apt to harm as to heal".

Surgery in particular has become super specialized. They joke about right ear surgeons and left ear surgeons. But mistakes are still common, and 150k people die per year after surgeries (3x road fatalities). More training and specialization can't be the answer, since surgeons already have so much training and specialization. 

Chapter 2: The Checklist
-------------------------------
In 1935 Boeing tested the B17 Flying Fortress, the most advanced plane ever. The test pilot was very experienced, but crashed the plane because he forgot to unlock a rudder control. Other test pilots got together and decided that instead of more training (the test pilot had plenty), they would create a checklist. So the pre-flight check list was born. 

In 2001, a doctor at Johns Hopkins created a five-step checklist for installing central lines (a foot-long instrument inserted into a patient’s chest). The goal was reduce infections. It worked so well others didn’t believe him. When other hospitals finally tried his central line checklist, it proved equally effective. Infection rates went to zero, and hundreds of lives were saved. Nurses were empowered to stop doctors who were about skip a step. Doctors were rushed and stressed, and the simple reminder to wash etc proved extremely effective.

Results were repeated with other procedures, such as putting a patient on a ventilator, and getting ready for certain kinds of in-coming emergencies. Checklists are great.
